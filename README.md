Fixing the odd nooks and crannies still mildly broken in IPv4, by:

- Making class-e (240/4), 0/8, 127/8, 224/4 more usable
- Adding 419 million new IPs to the world
- Fixing [zeroth networking](LOWEST.md)
- Improving interoperability with multiple protocols and tunnelling technologies
- Supplying tested patches and tools that address these problems
